title: On Data Science Career.

I'm Vuong. I'm a Data Scientist @ Spiraledge, Inc. I'm building stuffs out here in Saigon, VietNam.


As a Data Scientist, I build data products.


The product can be just as small as an averaging number, or as big as a 10-folds boosted tree model. 
The process of building such a product leverages useful data, and it has to be carried by rigorous scientific methods.

It's the Science (in Data Science) that got me into the field ( awesome machine learning models, data manipulation techniques at scales...).

The Science  means that you need a scientific framework, and proper tools to do the job. Outliers should be treated, and Expected Value should be used instead of arithmetic mean in case of skewed distribution (Only in thin-tail symmetric distribution like Gaussian distribution, mean mode, median hold the same value and can be used interchangeably)

However, at one point in time, i realize that, Data Science is 20% model building and 80% everything else.

That 80% parts including things like:

	- defining a business goal of the project (Without a goal, you can't score).
	- defining a metric to evaluate the product (How will you know this thing improves the bottom line, if you can't size it). Sometimes, you have to make sure that the metric is first understandable and second useful.
	- getting the data that you need, and ensure data quality. This is, in my opinion, is the hardest part. It dictates the quality of the model (Garbage in, garbage out). And it's time consuming. In cases, we have to throw away useful data, things that helps but not consistent (Manual invoices in excel sheets, corrupted data...)
	- communicating with stakeholders with results, supports. In the end, the products that we build will be put to use as a by other people, we have to make sure that people understand how to use it, and the tools work as it supposed to.

As a Data Science Team Leader, I help other people build data products. 

It requires visions of how decision should be made based on facts (not all of the visions a mine, thought :) And with that, we need plans. How do we fit that plans into the grand scheme, and make people to buy into that plan is an important part of the job. 

Data Science projects deadline range from days to months, and a growth mindset is required to make sure that we can go all along the way.
