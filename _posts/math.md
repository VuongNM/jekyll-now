Learning Math, the script kiddie way 


This afternoon, I was going though a post about an Top track entrance test in my alma mater. I was intrigued with one of the task.


I was astounded that I have a clear hunch on stategy to attack the problem, by trying to reduce the complexity shown.

It struck me that, I can clearly get this when I was 18, now 10 years later. I can still feel the way to do it, but clearly I stuck. I don't know what to do next. I wolframed the function, it's clearly right. Then all of a sudden, I realized that I don't know how to prove inequalities, at least right at that moment. 

Reflecting on my journey in Math since I was a kid

When I was a kid, I was deemed as bright enough for a somewhat selected school. 


I was never educated to ask why, in my entire time as a student. The question "How do you prove inequality ?" was never raised, or asked, or discussed. However, "Prove me this inequality that talk last 2 lesson" was in for a big time. All after thousands of them, never once I asked myself or someone come ask me that starry question. 


This is one interesting point, because I can passed the test just fine, landing high scores and all. But it never stick to me that I need a general plan or a strategy on an problem.


Then i saw a Havard entrance test.

All things flipped. It clearly shows that, in order to get in, you have to understand things. Concepts. Strategies. Along with showing your skills on specific domains.


I was astounded by the 2 approach Vietnamese Education and the US Education take. The incentives give out by the tests clearly attract different peoples. It shows to me that, the US university want people that understand things, and on top of that, desire to understand things. This is important, as that desire will grow them into great scientist. Vietnamese side attract students with an expensive toolset. 


I had some toolset, but the fact that I'm doing different things now, so the toolset that I got is left to rust. I was like a mechanic fixing air intake, without knowing how combustion engine works. Now I fix computers, I dont bring heavy pliers.
